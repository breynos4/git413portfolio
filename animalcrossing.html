            <h1>Animal Crossing Fandom Wiki</h1>
            <p>Client asked for a fully coded website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery elements fixed at 1280px. The website used JQuery for the API and character tabs. JavaScript was used for the image slideshow and list maker.</p>
            <p>The goal of this website was to create an Animal Crossing Fandom Wiki for those beginning to get into the series. The slideshow shows all the Animal Crossing games available with text introduction to the series. The weather API shows your local weather (your local weather actually has no correlation to the in-game weather). The character bios feature three of my favorite characters and the user is able to make a list of all the games at the bottom and can check them off once they try them out.</p>
            <p>I used a lot of greens when making this website, including the iconic grass pattern for the background. It's a colorful game so I made sure to show that through my design.</p>
            <p>Client was very satisfied with the final results.</p>
