            <h1>Pui Pui Molcar Fan Site</h1>
            <p>Client asked for a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript fixed at 1280px. The focus of the website was about Pui Pui Molcar and included a link to Netflix streaming, merch shopping tab, bios for the main molcars, a form to contact the owner, and a dark mode toggle. The goal was to create the first Pui Pui Molcar fanpage that told users about the characters and offered easy merch purchasing.</p>
            <p>The colors used for this website follow the Pui Pui Molcar logo. I included images in every spot I could to show how cute the molcars are! I also wanted to use bright colors since the show is very cheerful.</p>
            <p>Execution was successful and incorporated all elements that were asked to include.</p>
